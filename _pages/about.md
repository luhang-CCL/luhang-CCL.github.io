Hang Lu is currently an Associate Professor and Master Tutor at the State Key Laborotary of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He is a member of the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS, and the New Best Star of ICT. He received the BS degree and MS degree of Beihang University (major: Electronic and Information Engineering) at 2008 and 2011 respectively, and received the Ph.d of the University of Chinese Acedemy of Sciences (major: Computer Architecture).

His research interest is Customizable Computing, which entails a series of key research areas regarding power efficient oriented computing platforms, including AI chip design, deep learning, cryptography etc. He and his teammates have explored the software/hardware co-design targeting the AI chip design, deep neural network pruning and quantization, fast video understanding, video super resolution and deployment for mobile platform. The researches have been published on various  international leading conferences and journals like MICRO、HPCA、DAC、ICCAD、TCAD、TVLSI、ICPP、ICCD、ASPDAC, and awarded as the best paper candidate once. He owns 8 PCTs, authorized by China, USA, EU, Japan, South Korea. Within the last 10 years, he directly presides or participates multiple NSFC projects as well as the collaborative projects with Huawei, OPPO and JNICT. Besides, he has published one monograph and one translation respectively, and served as the reviewer or session chair of many top conferences in his research area. He received a number of awards as the Ph.d candidate as well.

## Customizable Computing Lab

The researches in this Lab focus on new strategies for "Customizable Computing". To represent its accurate definition, I intend to cite the statements from Prof. Jason Cong -- “Since its establishment in 2009, the Center for Domain-Specific Computing (CDSC) has focused on customizable computing. We believe that future computing systems will be customizable with extensive use of accelerators, as custom-designed accelerators often provide 10-100X performance/energy efficiency over the general-purpose processors. Such an accelerator-rich architecture presents a fundamental departure from the classical von Neumann architecture, which emphasizes efficient sharing of the executions of different instructions on a common pipeline, providing an elegant solution when the computing resource is scarce. In contrast, the accelerator-rich architecture features heterogeneity and customization for energy efficiency; this is better suited for energy-constrained designs where the silicon resource is abundant and spatial computing is favored-which has been the case with the end of Dennard scaling. Currently, customizable computing has garnered great interest; for example, this is evident by Intel's $17 billion acquisition of Altera in 2015 and Amazon's introduction of field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs) in its AWS public cloud. ”

**We consider this hot topic from both the software and hardware perspective, and seek to find an appropriate way to <span style="color:#953734;">design the customizable computing platform to serve the intelligent and secure systems</span>. Our research interests include:**
  * State-of-the-art Deep Learning Algorithms, i.e. the hottest vision transformer, video super resolution, object detection etc. 
  * New Hardware Architectures, i.e. sparsity-aware deep learning accelerators
  * Privacy-Preserving Computing, i.e. homomorphic encryption 
  * RISC-V Open-Source Processor
